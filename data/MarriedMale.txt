In order to really reach the lost and hurting there has to be a certain feeling attached to your emotions - uncomfortableness.
God pursues and then meets us where we are - not where we think we should be.

Faith will always get you through any dilemma.
How do you make a difference in people's lives? By being active and seeking ppl out. You can't create momentum, unless you move.
Sterilized Christianity doesn't work. Go work in slums, w/ homeless, prostitutes, addicts, the hungry, the sick, widows, orphans, etc...
To be in God's will, your starting point must be humility.

"The delays of God... are always purposeful." - Alistair Begg
The Oval Office does not define Christian America, but Christian America can direct the Oval Office. Pray for a Godly America. .
Don't let your walk with God become "a dragging of feet." Worship Him, read the Word, pray, connect w/ believers, share Jesus w/ others.

"The ‚Äúwill to win‚Äù is not what wins the game. The game was won long before it was played." Be focused and disciplined.
"Repentance is not a merely intellectual change of mind or mere grief, but a radical transformation of the entire person." .@DACarson_
‚ÄúLet eloquence be flung to the dogs rather than souls be lost. What we want is to win souls. They are not won by flowery speeches.‚Äù C.H.S.
Should a believer, when witnessing, be kind? God thinks so - I Peter 3:15. We are to love God and to love people Matt 22:37-40. #BeLoving
The smile is often the best way to bridge the gap when sharing your faith.
When sharing your faith you will share a "great deal of disagreeable truth" (Spurgeon), but that doesn't mean you cannot smile. #BeAFriend
People, in pursuit of sin, will effortlessly cast God aside. God, despite our rebellion, will pursue us relentlessly. #Repent&amp;Believe
.@drjamesmerritt :Jesus called us to find people in dark places and to move towards those who need Him. #52WeeksWithJesus
.@drjamesmerritt: You don't have to ask people to look @ you when you turn on a light in a dark room. Their heads turn automatically.

You can make progress through your trouble, suffering, responsibility, or whatever is trying to hold u back. Bind yourself 2 God &amp; His word.
Commit yourself to praise instead of complaining‚Ä¶..
Faith involves believing what God has said in spite of the difficulties you face:
Go ahead and ask God, but while you wait for answers you are called to trust in God, even when you don‚Äôt fully understand what He is doing.
Jesus died for you and me to free us from a dark, rebellious life into this good, pure life, making us a people he can be proud of.
Our culture dislikes¬†the idea of holiness, but when people see a faithful Christian life they are captivated by it.
My heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end.  Psalm 119:112
Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path. Psalm 119:105
Psalm 119:105 (MSG) ‚ÄòBy your words I can see where I‚Äôm going; they throw a beam of light on my dark path.‚Äô
Sometimes circumstances n our lives can seem very bleak. Everything goes wrong. Darkness  sets n.‚Ä¶ God never leaves u without a ray of hope.
You need encouragement to keep going and God‚Äôs word is your heritage forever and the joy of your journey.
Christians are not on a journey to the end, but to the beginning‚Ä¶.
Be careful out there today and let the love of God rule in your hearts.
Read the Bible regularly, always educating yourself in the Christian faith.
Success in the christian life is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Be persistent in your Christian faith. Make an effort each and every day to serve someone in some small way.
He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Psalm 23:3
A person with proper moral character will have a positive influence on the character of others.
This is the bottom line‚Ä¶..He does not believe that does not live according to his belief
Mother Teresa: "Words which do not give the light of Christ increase the darkness."
Neglect God's word and you will be over run with worldly thoughts, and your life will become a moral chaos.
We have learned to live with unholiness and have come to look upon it as the natural and expected thing. God forgive us.
We must meet the uncertainties of this world with the certainty of God‚Äôs promises to us‚Ä¶.
We are so much better together, yet we are dying of loneliness.
For death is no more than a turning of us over from time to eternity. ~William Penn
God has made everything beautiful in its time. Even death when it comes to a christian will be a beautiful thing.
‚ÄòYour own soul is nourished when you are kind; it is destroyed when you are cruel.‚Äù Proverbs 11:17 (TLB)
Prayer - secret, fervent, believing prayer - lies at the root of all personal godliness. Now that u know that, will you pray?
I am thankful that when my mood changes , and it often does, God's love for me does not. I can always count on that.
God is unmovable, unchangeable, and unstoppable. Regardless of where you are in life, He is the anchor that will secure you.
Pray regardless of what you are feeling. God is still there and still the Great I Am, even when you don't feel like praying.
Obedience is not an act of feelings but of the will in obedience to God. Obey not b/c u feel like it but b/c God commanded it.
Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice. This is a day He has made for you. Honor Him in it.
Warning!  Satan tries 2 defeat u by tempting u 2 trust your own wisdom, 2 live according 2 your self-centered feelings‚Ä¶..
God's will 4 you today is for you to be an overwhelming conqueror in all temptations for His honor and glory.
Practice biblical love for others in spite of adverse circumstances or your feelings to the contrary. Let Jesus love through you.
Trust God's love and power in you more than you believe your own feelings and experiences and you can love those around you.
Note to self: Where there is a decision between God's word and my feelings‚Ä¶.That is a no brainer‚Ä¶God's word prevails.
Obedience means marching right on whether we feel like it or not. That is where the strength of God kicks in &amp; carries u through.
Confession time‚Ä¶. I am great at loving humanity but find it difficult at times to love my neighbor.  God help me‚Ä¶
There is nothing so deluding as feelings. They will tell you this and then that, and in the end don't really know what you want or need.
Sight is not faith, and hearing is not faith, neither is feeling faith; but believing when we neither see, hear, nor feel is faith. HWSmith
God is a God of order, not confusion. Confusion and chaos comes from the father of confusion‚Ä¶.Satan.
Hell is the highest reward that the devil can offer you for being a servant of his. Billy Sunday
In the midst of heaven itself Lucifer could think of nothing but his own prestige. Are we not all like that at times?
