I will never get crazy folk....because I ain't one. #notetoself
That moment someone dramatic in your life starts to make their exit. #goodbye #aintgottimeforthat #dramafree #goodbye
That moment the ex only wants him because another quality chick does too. #singlegalbanter
The people on my HOA Facebook page just bit$h and complain &amp; spread paranoia about possible crime. Really do they have nothing else to do?
When a man sends you ratchet pics and you laugh vs getting annoyed...you must really like that man. Lol
Why do we love ratchet tv?
That moment you walk into the office hella late and you want to channel @iluvmariah and say "Yaaaaas....she's here!"
I think I like him a little too much....but feels good.
Whatever happened to that sign language interpreter... #BETHONORS
She took it to CHURCH!!! #Aretha #BETHONORS
I will still never understand why my dad said I looked "bout like Aretha Franklin" that time....shrug, but she is a phenom #BETHONORS

That moment you realize your girl was tipsy &amp; really didn't see what she thought she saw + the moment you realize this is history repeated
Missed @WhitneyMixterLA and Sara on my tv....but hate seeing them seem disconnected on Couples Therapy.
So this dude calls and leaves a vooce message saying he is tired and going to sleep then friend sees him at local bar. #datingsucks
Maturity really, really, has nothing at all to do with age.
Some1 calls you accidentally at 3AM in morning &amp; hangs up (instead of apologizing). Do you a)Post their number on #socmed b)Get over it? smh
#nowwatching #TLC #CrazySexyCool  and lol @ "Pebbitone"
The hair salon is ultimately the best place for gossip, debate and news.
So a guy from http://t.co/Q8CX7zBncP who I went on one date with, emailed me on POF like he didn't recognize me and the email was same. SMH
Yeah I am not a fan of Ben Affleck taking on the role of Batman... Worst pick since Val Kilmer...At least he was good in Tombstone
Think there are just as many, bitter, jaded, hurt and "angry" men out there as women...from the dating game. #Relationships #datingdisasters
Still not ready to date someone with more than 2 kids &amp; 2 baby moms....Doesn't mean they aren't good men-just not ready for that #facefacts
I've met a couple of guys who are my height...shorter than me in heels. This would normally be a deal breaker..but why? Realizing thats dumb
Just had a round about conversation with a male friend who just doesn't want to admit he ignored signs that his ex was crazy... smh
That sinking feeling when you realize someone just @ you to someone who does multilevel marketing on Instagram. #sigh
Met a very attractive personal trainer today while out running errands. I am sure his flirtation was a ploy to get a new client but was nice
So I am on POF now.... as in Plenty of Fish. I have rewritten two guys profiles....because they were THAT bad. They thanked me and reposted.

A lovely cup of coffee on a chilly day
I've been really missing summer camp lately
You know you have your priorities straight when you reach over to shield your Taco Bell from falling
You know what, I'm tired of trying to hang out with my "friends" for them to just ditch me and hang out with someone else.
Man, I wish it was Friday
If you can't give up the single life, then you don't get to take away someone else's.

Maybe you are single at this time because you're so caught up in finding a man, that you just haven't learned to be content with yourself.
This past weekend was the longest, most tiring weekend I've had in a long time.
Now, learn from my mistakes. Do not. I repeat. Do not drink 3 ice teas within 8 hours. You'll regret it.
Coffee is my best friend today
Me: people need to stop counting down till Christmas Co-worker: oh, it's 72 days till Christmas!  Me: go home Susan..
How can people afford to take so many road trips? I can barely afford to put gas in my tank let alone drive to another state
Why do I miss you, when all you did was break my heart?
I know I'm nothing special and I'm super awkward but I give good hugs and I can give you compliments regularly
I know everything happens for a reason. But sometimes I wish I knew what that reason was.
When you are going through something hard and wonder where GOD is, remember that the teacher is always quiet during the test. 🙏
Time decides who you meet in life, but your heart decides who you stays in your life
We're not friends. We're strangers with memories.
Don’t let your struggle become your identity.
As you breath right now, another person takes his last. So stop complaining, and learn to live your life with what you got.
You'll never find the right things, If you don't let go of the wrong ones.
People with a sense of humor are so much easier to talk to.
Some people don't notice the things we do for them, until we stop doing them..
If you want to know something, just ask. Don't assume.
If you trade what you need long term for what you want in a moment of impulsiveness, all that you will find is unhappiness.
Being nice to someone you hate doesn't mean you're fake. It means you're mature enough to tolerate your hate towards them.
Sometimes it takes the worst pain to bring about the best change.
Have faith that things will work out, maybe not how you planned but how it was meant to be.
People tell you to stay strong, when they have no idea how hard it is to do so.
Being faithful isn't hard if you really care about them.
Respect All. Fear None.
Claim your girl, love your girl, fuck your girl, spoil your girl, be faithful to your girl, trust your girl &amp; she will stay your girl.
Always find a reason to laugh. It may not add years to your life but will surely add life to your years.
Don't give up just because things seem hard.
I just need a day off from reality, just a day without people, problems, and all the bullshit that runs through my mind.
Have faith that things will work out, maybe not how you planned but how it was meant to be.
To change your life, you have to change yourself. To change yourself, you have to change your mindset.
❒Taken ❒Single ✔ Dont care anymore.
Don't make time for people that don't make time for you.
Life is unpredictable and you never know what is coming next. Don't ever get too comfortable. Always be ready to change.
I can't promise you a perfect relationship, but what I can promise you is that if you're trying, I'm staying.
Have a dream and follow it. Have a plan and stick to it. Have a goal and achieve it.
She didn’t stop loving you. she just decided to stop showing it.. Because no matter how much she tried, you just wouldn’t get it.
I’m not perfect, but I’m loyal.
I don't need a perfect relationship... I just need someone who won't give up on me.
The worst feeling in the world is when you know that you both love each other but still you just can't be together.
Loyal girls deserve the World. 🌎❤
When you stop chasing the wrong things, you give the right things a chance to catch you.
Planning things in your head, hoping one day it happens.
Keep it simple. Keep it honest. Keep it real.
You gotta stand for something, or you'll fall for nothing.
You don't care, so why should I?
Good or bad, I trust in God's plan.
If I don't fuck with you anymore, it's probably your fault. I'm speaking in general cause I don't just cut people off for no reason.
Worry about your character, not your reputation. Your character is who you are. Your reputation is who people think you are.
Not giving a fuck is better than revenge.
Mentally, I'm drained. Emotionally, I'm done. Spiritually, I'm dead. Physically, I smile.
Don't let someone else control what you do in life. It's your decisions, your outcomes, your life.
Don't settle for being someone's something, be with someone who makes you their everything.
I have NO BEEF with NOBODY. I'm chilling. 😎 Might have a couple of BITCHES &amp; NIGGAS that don't like me, but they ain't making NO NOISE 🔇
Don't believe rumors, only believe what you see
You can never "Just be friends" with someone you fell in love with.
Just leave it alone, if it's meant to be, it will happen.
I'm still hoping, I'm still waiting and I feel stupid.

The only 3 things a guy should wanna change about his girl is her last name, her address and her viewpoint on men.
I hate those people who only talk to you when they need something.
The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you couldn't do.
A ride or die chick means that you're there for him when he's down &amp; out. Not when he cheats multiple times &amp; you still stay!
In the end you'll know who's fake, who's true, and who will risk it all for you.
It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.
Girls remember everything.
It's better to be young and stupid than old and regretful.
When you give up, it means you never wanted it.
We argue, we fight, but we always end up alright... That's real
You never really stop loving someone. You just learn to try to live without them.
Minus the bullshit, life's great.
Fuck me over and it's fuck you forever..
I'm single because I'm waiting for the right time in the right place with a right person.
Don't promise to always be there for someone, and then leave when they need you the most.
You can't have your cake and eat it too boo 😏
God is working things out for you, even when you don't feel it. Have faith and be thankful.
Whatever happens between us, should stay between us.
Never give up on something you really want. Its difficult to wait, but more difficult to regret.
Hate the feeling of not knowing whether to give up or keep trying.
Today is not just another day. It's a new opportunity, another chance, a new beginning. Embrace it.
You have to completely let go of the past if you want to truly move forward.
If you still talk about it, you still care about it.
Feeling appreciated is the best feeling.
Babe = (B)efore (a)ny(b)ody (e)lse👌
Don't assume my tweets are about you. But if you’re affected by them, then that obviously means you’re guilty of something.
I get jealous and you're not even mine...
Once you realize you deserve better, letting go will be the best decision you will ever make.
The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think.
I didn't change. You just never knew me..
The biggest mistake I've made in my life, is letting people stay in my life far longer than they deserve to.
What comes easy, won't last. What lasts, won't come easy...
Relationships last longer when everybody doesn't know your business.
I ain't the jealous type, but what's mine is mine. Don't fuck with it..
When someone shows you how they really are, Don't try to paint a new picture.
Don't judge what people do, if you don't know what they've been through.
I hate those people who only talk to you when they need something..
Put a condom on your heart, and fuck your feelings.
Trust a few, fuck the rest....
The best thing in life is finding someone who knows all of your flaws, mistakes, and weaknesses and still thinks you're completely amazing.
Only break bread with people you starved with..
You're kinda, sorta, basically, pretty much always on my mind.
Don't cry because they left. Just smile because they gave you a chance to find someone better.
The less you worry about what people think, the less complicated life becomes.
A real friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
Take your chances or watch someone take them from you.
Tough times don't last, tough people do..
I distance myself from bullshit..
The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you couldn't do.
No expectations, no disappointments.
How can I watch #Emmerdale tonight? Just the thought of #Cain leaving the village makes my body shudder. I can't watch him go. I just can't.
Hate being home in daytime because I get so bored. But, I must say I've enjoyed watching #Hawaii5-0 for the last 2 hours! #McGarrett #Sky1
After a week of pouring a mixture of #OliveOil &amp; #TeaTreeOil in BOTH of my ears &amp; now having gone half deaf, I've arranged a GP home visit.👂
Great to see the @LBC advertisement on TV after the #ITV news tonight. First time I've seen it! #NickFerrari &amp; #JamesOBrian looking good! 📻
Another day stuck home because I'm poorly sick. On plus side, my throat is better. On negative side, I now have earache/pain in both ears.👂😷
So I've taken day off work because of my painful earache and grotty throat. The day is going so SLOW as I don't feel like doing ANYTHING 😑 😷
I've put up with on/off earache in my right ear for last 10 days or so. Now I think I should've seen GP as left side of throat is so sore 😢.
So! #Mo is pregnant, #MrT is engaged, #Jac has a new sister who also happens to be a doctor &amp; dating #Ollie, and #Serena is gay. Wow #Holby!
Oh yes, now it's #HolbyCity. Been MONTHS since I saw that -can't even remember ANY storylines from that time. Probably has whole new cast!
Now I just need to catch up on all #soap "goings on". Hope I've not missed good/important stuff or anything building up to #Xmas storylines.
Been WEEKS since I watched any #soaps. Last time was just before #Olympics2016 began. Just missed #Emmerdale -but in time for #EastEnders!
Hope you all having good week? Mine fine. Anyone feeling offish? Felt so groggy at midday I could've dozed off. Must be #seasonal changes.
Haven't been on Twitter much recently as been incredibly busy at work. At a glance it seems nothing much has changed, tweet me if I'm wrong.
Yesterday it was sunny &amp; so very warm (28c). Today there is thick fog. What is with the #UKWeather lately? https://t.co/GrRXKfxHqS
It's windy, tipping down with rain &amp; was on the chilly side overnight. So much for us having a final week of "Indian" summer! #UKWeather
#NowWatching: #Batman (1989). I'd just turned 8yrs old &amp; I watched it with my "cool" Uncle. I remember thinking female outfits were so glam!
Woah! Had some AMAZING dreams in last 3hrs -thanks to dose of #OraMorph for agonising pain. Pity I lost touch with man who featured in them!
Lovely morning &amp; perfect #weather for #planes flying into @bhx_official to create pretty #contrails. #Clouds (2/2) https://t.co/i3rThuJIn0

Catching up on recent episodes of #Gotham. Can't bear to see scary #DrHugoStrange of #Arkham -he'll always be #DrHuang from #LawAndOrderSVU!
Caught up with tonight's #Emmerdale. So strange watching the #Belle/#DrBailey affair storyline. Reminds me of when I was in same situation.
#Holly's in PRIVATE room &amp; not on WARD ..BUT still, it resembles REAL #NHS hospital -colours/gown/sheets/blankets! No duvet etc! #Emmerdale
Incredibly glad I decided against going to the #F1 #MonacoGP this year. Such horrid weather. For fun in Monaco you do need the sun!
As for the so called "assault" on the police officer which resulted in a charge of #ABH -utterly ridiculous! #Corrie #Izzy #Cannabis
Are we really supposed to believe sensible woman/mom (with previous drug caution) refused #solicitor for interview? #Corrie #Izzy #Cannabis
To top it all off, I'm in such #pain with both my (older) #back &amp; (more recent) #arm/#elbow #injuries. Plus damn #hayfever driving me crazy!
Ugh. #AwfulDay! My head/brain feel tired/fried from sheer amount of stuff that has gone in them &amp; my mouth/throat ache from what's come out!
I'm so torn. Much as I'd love a #Vettel win, it would be great for young #Verstappen to get a win on his #RedBull debut. #F1 #SpanishGP
#Hamilton literally throwing his toys out of the pram when he threw that steering wheel out of the car! #F1 #SpanishGP
I'd love a #CainDingle in my life! Those faded jeans, his hair turning salt/pepper &amp; always so quick when a punch needs throwing! Emmerdale
ARGH! I have been suffering with #Hayfever symptoms since 4:30am. It's so annoying. #IHateSummer
Hope you have all had a good start to  your #BankHoliday weekend. Is anyone out there doing anything of noteable interest or excitement?!
#Sharon threw her dart on an empty board &amp; it landed on 3. But when she took darts off board, there wasn't one on 3. #Eastenders #Continuity
#DrBailey won't take #Belle to a hotel because his wife will spot it on his credit card statement. Use cash not card! #Affair101 #Emmerdale
Now #Prince is dead -who will be next?! #2016TheYearOfTheDeadCelebs
It looks much prettier through my window &amp; eye (rather than an iPhone camera lens!). #Sunrise #Queenat90 #BSTDay26 https://t.co/wRISAfRkIW
I really want a dog!!
The heart break comes in waves.
I'm freezing. 😩
I'll write on your dick with sharpie while you're sleeping. Lol.
If life weren't complicated, it surely would be perfect.
I need to go to the gym.
I can't tell if I'm losing it or if I'm becoming more sane.
My first and only love.
My face doesn't hide much.
I've never been in so much pain..
If you date this girl, I'll know I didn't really mean shit to you. I spent 2 and a half years so you could date this chick in a month.
School is so stressful.
I walk a lonely road, the only road that I have ever know. Don't know where it goes but to me it's home and walk alone.
If I had a time machine, I'd change so many things but you're moving on and I'm still me..
You said you'd always be here but it was stupid of me to believe you.
I'm completely alone.
I'm a ticking time bomb.
I think I'm gonna stay single. I'm still in love with my first.
I'd do anything but even that isn't enough.
You have my heart. I don't feel alive without you but now you're gone and my heart has yet to beat.
Heart break is the worst thing I've ever went through. I lost the one thing I love most and it's gonna forever.
I feel like a bomb about to explode. I will never fall in love again....
I'm pissed and hurt..
Don't you hate it when the one you love starts falling for someone else?
I need help moving on. 😩
Not even the Gods above, can separate the two of us.
I want a dog more that I want food. Lol.
I like off brand pop tarts.
This world is pointless and so are friends. I'll be okay by myself in the end. Life goes on but I am done, it's over. It's time to run.
Life just isn't what I expected.
I hate waking up knowing it's over and there's nothing I can do about it.
Say something I'm not giving up on you.
I miss everything. I fucked up. I'm done... Goodnight...
My heart breaks a little more each time you text me..
Life is not a fairy tale, my prince is gone.
I wish I could show you what you mean to me but it's too late and I'm too weak.
I'm a pathetic person and I've come to be okay with that if it means I can love you forever..
With a broken heart and a broken smile, I let you go but in the longest mile. http://t.co/QMC8GxmIaa
No one could ruin this mood.
Today is gonna be a good day. http://t.co/5tRSlGnMy5
I dissected a cat in anatomy.
When you're doped up on sleeping pills.
Just because I like this picture. http://t.co/daTJSdL7se
I wake up at random times, play on my phone for 10 minutes, then go back to sleep.
All I think about is sleep, sex and happiness.
It's not that I don't want to get out of bed, I never want to get out of bed.
I can't decided if I want to text people or not.
I look sad all the time, because I am.
I hate when I'm upset and it makes me want to throw up...
I need to be more positive!
Guys, I may be about to get my Twitter back after all these years.! :'D Twitter Support is finally helping me. cx
